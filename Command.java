/**
 * This class is part of the Lockdown application. 
 * Lockdown is a very simple, text based adventure game. 
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command can consist of two strings: a second
 * word and a third word of the users input and a boolean that
 * keeps track is the game needs to end or not.
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Command is an abstract superclas for each 
 * of the valid commands executions in this game. 
 * It runs a main method of a specific subclass for every command
 * word identified in the parser (a list is initialised in the Game class)
