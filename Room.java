/**
 * Class Room - a room in an adventure game.
 *
 * This class is part of the Lockdown application. 
 * Lockdown is a very simple, text based adventure game. 
 *
 * A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game and 
 * is represented by a description.  
 * It is connected to other rooms via exits.  For each existing exit, the room 
 * stores a reference to the neighboring room.
 * It can store multiple items as well as people.
 * A Room can be a control one, such that the player should do additional
 * stuff here so he can advance in the game.
