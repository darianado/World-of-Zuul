/**
 *  This class is the main class of the Lockdown application. 
 *  Lockdown is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
 *  can walk around some scenery and play around with
 *  different commnads on items and other people. 
 *  They need to find and execute a mission
 *  in a time limit in order to win.
 *  
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, the people, creates the parser, creates the player and the mission
 *  and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
